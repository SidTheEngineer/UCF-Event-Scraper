# UCF Event Scraper

This is a Python script that scrapes campus event information from UCF's events.ucf.edu website, formats the information, and dumps it to JSON. This information can be saved to a database and be used in pre-populating the map of the Pinz app with events.

Events are scraped using BeautifulSoup4
