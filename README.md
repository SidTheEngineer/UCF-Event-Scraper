#UCF Event Scraper

This is a Python script that scrapes campus event information from UCF's events.ucf.edu website, formats the information, and dumps it to JSON. This information is saved to a database and will be used in pre-populating the map of the Campus Pins app with events.

Events are scraped by the week using BeautifulSoup4.
